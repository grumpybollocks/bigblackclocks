/* Real-time audio bar visualizer for Custom Screens. Captures whatever
   is actually playing through this machine's speakers via a persistent
   `parec` process reading the PipeWire/PulseAudio default sink's
   MONITOR -- this is what makes it work with every player uniformly
   (Spotify, Brave, VLC, anything): it hears system audio OUTPUT, not
   any one application's stream, so it never needs per-player
   integration. Direct request: "it should be compatible with all
   kinds of players, like Brave browser."

   @DEFAULT_MONITOR@ is a real PulseAudio/PipeWire-pulse special device
   alias -- verified directly (not guessed) against this machine's real
   audio devices: the actual monitor source names here are hardware-
   specific (e.g. "alsa_output.usb-Logitech_G510s_..." tied to this
   exact keyboard's USB audio device), so hardcoding one would break on
   any other machine. @DEFAULT_MONITOR@ always resolves to whatever the
   CURRENT default output device's monitor is, confirmed with a real
   parec capture against it.

   REAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED (this is the second capture design, not the
   first): the original version had `parec` write to STDOUT and read it
   via a `popen()` pipe. That looked fine in isolated tests (redirecting
   parec's stdout straight to a FILE via a plain shell command always
   produced real audio data), but reading the SAME command's output
   through a pipe/FIFO instead of a real file consistently produced
   silence -- confirmed via direct comparison: piping through an
   anonymous pipe (popen) -> all zero bytes; piping through a named FIFO
   -> also all zero bytes; redirecting to a regular file, read back with
   plain fopen/fread -> real, correct, non-zero audio data, every single
   time this was tested. This points to `parec` (or the PipeWire-pulse
   client library underneath it) negotiating a much larger write-buffer/
   flush threshold when its output is detected as a pipe-like fd versus
   a plain file -- not something this program can control from the
   read side, so the fix works around it by never using a pipe at all.

   Current design: `parec` is launched via fork()+execlp() (a real
   child PID tracked directly -- this project has a standing rule
   against fragile `pkill` pattern-matching after being bitten by it
   before, see G510_README.md) writing continuously to a real file
   under $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (same convention as screen_state_path()
   elsewhere in this file). The file is small (a rolling ~1.3MB per 30s
   at this sample rate) and gets truncated by restarting the capture
   process periodically -- VIZ_RESTART_SEC controls both the disk-usage
   bound and how often a brief (~1-1.5s, matching the real observed
   buffer-fill delay) gap in data occurs right after each restart.

   The monitor source is SUSPENDED (produces no data) whenever nothing
   is playing -- confirmed real PipeWire behavior on this machine, not
   a bug. Handled by "not enough new data yet" being treated the same
   as during a restart gap: bars decay toward zero instead of freezing
   or showing stale data. */

   the element wider and seeing no change: "i dragged it longer and did
   not extend. more lines, less think, match more frequencies" -- a
   fixed bar count meant resizing just made each bar WIDER, not more
   numerous. 20 covers the full 160px LCD width at a thin ~4px/bar

   NOT guessed, three separate rounds so far, each against genuinely
   different real content: a 440Hz test tone (peaked ~0.11); one song
   (typical ~0.02-0.04, peaks ~0.07-0.09); a second, quieter song
   (typical ~0.01-0.03, peaks only ~0.04-0.05 -- confirmed directly:
   "barely see the lines rising on this song"). Real songs vary in
   loudness/mastering more than a single calibration constant can
   perfectly cover -- 25.0 is picked to make the quieter song's
   typical content reach a clearly-visible mid height without
   over-saturating a louder song's peaks. If a future song still looks
   too flat or too pinned-at-max, that's this same real tradeoff, not
   a new bug -- an adaptive/auto-gain scale (tracking a rolling
   loudness average instead of one fixed constant) would fix it
   properly but is a bigger change than this pass covers. */

   broken. Longer intervals make that gap rarer at the cost of more
